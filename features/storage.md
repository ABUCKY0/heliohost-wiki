# Storage

HelioHost offers 1000 MB of web space with each of its hosting accounts. This figure combines your stored files and your databases. This should be more than enough to handle any forum, blog, or other script you might need to host. Sites that might encounter problems with this limit include photo galleries with high-megapixel images or online storage sites. In general, this limit should not be a problem to the great majority of free hosting users.
