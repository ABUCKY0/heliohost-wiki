# JSP

Java/JSP is only supported on [Tommy](../servers/virtual/tommy.md) and [Johnny](../servers/virtual/johnny.md). [Ricky](../servers/virtual/ricky.md) does not support it. Since JSP causes high load, we require each user to request it individually. To do this, log in to cPanel and press `Java Tomcat`. After you will join a queue for a Java slot. On Tommy, this process only takes a few hours. However, on Johnny, this can take days to weeks. To request Java, click [here](https://tommy.heliohost.org:2083/frontend/paper_lantern/java/index.live.php) for Tommy and [here](https://johnny.heliohost.org:2083/frontend/paper_lantern/java/index.live.php) for Johnny.
